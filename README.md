# The Algorithmic Fist

This web-based Rock Paper Scissors game allows players to challenge an AI opponent. The user interacts with visually appealing buttons depicting rock, paper, and scissors. The game utilizes JavaScript to determine the computer's choice, compare both selections, and display the result. Scores are kept for both the user and the computer, providing a competitive element. The game also provides user feedback through messages indicating the outcome of each round.

This project demonstrates the use of HTML for structuring the page, CSS for styling the elements, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and logic. It serves as a foundation for building upon the existing code base by incorporating additional features such as multiple rounds, score tracking, and visually appealing win/loss animations.
